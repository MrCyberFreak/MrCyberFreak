Welcome to my GitHub profile!

About me:
I am a self-taught computer science enthusiast with a focus on programming, web development and trading crypto currencies with algorithms. I am particularly interested in web3 development and blockchain technology, as well as incorporating AI into these areas of study. My goal is to become a skilled computer programmer, web developer and crypto trader, and I am currently working on developing my skills in these areas.

Projects I've started:

Discord Chatbot - A chatbot built using the OpenAI technology, integrated with my Discord server for fine-tuned usage and natural language processing capabilities.
OpenAI Integration - A program that connects OpenAI technology to other software applications, allowing for more efficient and accurate language processing capabilities.
Crypto Trading Algorithm - An algorithm that uses AI and machine learning techniques to analyze market trends and make trades in the crypto currency market.
I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am excited to share my progress and knowledge with the community on GitHub.
